# AI Integration for Modern Web Applications

Artificial Intelligence is no longer a future concept—it's a present-day necessity for competitive web applications. This guide walks you through integrating AI capabilities into your stack.

## Choosing the Right LLM Provider

### OpenAI
- **Pros**: Best-in-class models, extensive documentation, large ecosystem
- **Cons**: Higher cost, rate limits on free tier
- **Best for**: Chat interfaces, content generation, embeddings

### Anthropic (Claude)
- **Pros**: Better instruction following, longer context windows
- **Cons**: Newer API, smaller ecosystem
- **Best for**: Complex reasoning, long-form content analysis

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. Streaming Responses
Always implement streaming for better UX:
```typescript
const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [{role: "user", content: prompt}],
  stream: true,
});

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  const content = chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "";
  // Send to client via SSE or WebSocket
}
```

### 2. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
Combine your data with LLM capabilities:
1. Convert documents to embeddings
2. Store in vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector)
3. Query for relevant context
4. Include context in LLM prompt

### 3. Function Calling
Let AI interact with your APIs:
```typescript
const functions = [{
  name: "get_current_weather",
  description: "Get the current weather",
  parameters: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      location: {type: "string"},
    },
  },
}];
```

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: LLM APIs can fail. Implement retries with exponential backoff
2. **Cost Management**: Cache responses, use smaller models when possible
3. **Security**: Never send sensitive user data to third-party APIs
4. **Monitoring**: Track token usage, latency, and error rates

The AI revolution is here. Start integrating these capabilities into your products today.
