# React Performance Optimization in 2024

Performance isn't just about speed—it's about user experience, SEO rankings, and ultimately, business success. Here's how to optimize your React applications in 2024.

## Measuring Performance

Before optimizing, measure:
1. **Lighthouse**: Run audits on your production site
2. **React DevTools Profiler**: Identify slow components
3. **Web Vitals**: Track Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)

## Quick Wins

### 1. Code Splitting
Use React.lazy() and Suspense for route-based code splitting:
```jsx
const Dashboard = React.lazy(() => import('./Dashboard'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
      <Dashboard />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

### 2. Memoization
Use useMemo and useCallback strategically:
```jsx
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
  return computeExpensiveValue(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
```

### 3. Virtual Scrolling
For long lists, use react-window or @tanstack/virtual:
```jsx
import { useVirtualizer } from '@tanstack/react-virtual';

// Renders only visible rows
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Server Components (Next.js 13+)
Render components on the server to reduce bundle size:
```jsx
// This component never ships to the client
async function BlogPost({ id }) {
  const post = await db.getPost(id);
  return <article>{post.content}</article>;
}
```

### Streaming SSR
Stream HTML as it's generated:
```jsx
import { renderToReadableStream } from 'react-dom/server';
```

### Image Optimization
Use next/image or similar:
```jsx
<Image
  src="/hero.jpg"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
  priority
  alt="Hero"
/>
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-memoization**: Don't memoize everything
2. **Large Bundles**: Audit your dependencies regularly
3. **Unnecessary Re-renders**: Use React DevTools to find them
4. **Missing Keys**: Always use stable keys in lists

Remember: measure first, optimize second. Focus on user-perceived performance, not just raw metrics.
